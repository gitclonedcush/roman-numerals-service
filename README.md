# roman-numerals-service
A java web service to convert integers to roman numeral strings

* https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/cushind/roman-numerals-service

### Disclaimer
I don't come from a java microservice background and mainly work in asp.net core and golang. However, I wanted to do this project in java to familiarize myself with the various microservice and build frameworks. Overall, I think the language is pretty intuitive and fun to use, and gradle seems like a powerful build tool.

## Usage 

The main service endpoint is `/romannumeral` and can be used as follows:
* Request: `GET http://localhost:8080/romannumeral?query=12` 
* Response: `{ numeral: 12, romanNumeral: "XII" }`
* Request: `GET http://localhost:8080/romannumera?query=1.5`
* Response: `400 BAD_REQUEST`

Also available are the following `spring boot actuator` endpoints:
* `/actuator`
* `/actuator/health`
* `/actuator/info`
* `/actuator/metrics`
* `/actuator/httptrace`

## Build and Test Instructions

* Build and test with `./gradlew build`
* Run service with `./gradlew run`

## Dependencies

## Project Layout

* The main java service files are located in `src/main/java/romannumerals`
    * Here I've defined a simple class to convert numbers to roman numerals
    * This is also where I've chosen to put the roman numeral controller for simplicity
* Test files are located in `src/test/java/romannumerals`
    * Integration tests -- useful for testing the actual service endpoint including query param binding and bad requests.
    * Unit tests -- to test roman numeral conversion logic and edge cases.
* Application config is located in `/src/main/resources/application.yml`

## Testing
* Run tests with `./gradlew test` or with `./gradlew build`
* The tests are configured to show their status in console output.

## Spec
[Roman Numeral Spec](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RomanNumerals.html)

A number can be converted to a roman numeral with the following algorithm:
* If number is 0 return
* Repeat:
    * Lookup highest key that is less than number in roman numeral map
    * Append the corresponding value to roman numeral string
    * number = number - key
